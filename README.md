This is the repository to support our study with the title: "Breaking Connectivity Barriers: Does Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative Affect Global Logistics Performance?". The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large-scale infrastructure and economic development project, aims to revitalize trade routes and boost global trade. This study investigates the BRI's impact on logistics performance using a staggered two-way fixed effects model. We find the BRI significantly improves a country's LPI infrastructure score but not the overall index or other components. The decision to participate and the type of MoU signed (Trade & Investment, Financial Cooperation) are key drivers, with improvements taking five years to materialize. Our findings highlight the importance of infrastructure development for logistics performance and the need for studies that consider both economic and governance factors.
